# DTL-022: Epic: Universal Measure Suffix and Hiding Strategy

## Problem Statement

Problem: Currently, measures from semantic models are generated in LookML with their original names, which can create naming collisions with user-facing metrics. This mixing of internal measures and external metrics violates the separation of concerns principle from the dbt semantic layer.

Solution: Implement a universal naming convention where ALL semantic model measures get a `_measure` suffix and are marked as `hidden: yes`. Metrics that reference these measures will use the suffixed names, creating a clean separation.

Benefits:
- Clean separation between internal measures (hidden) and user-facing metrics (visible)
- No collision detection logic needed
- Aligns with dbt semantic layer philosophy (measures → metrics)
- Simple and maintainable

Impact Areas:
- schemas/semantic_layer.py: Measure.to_lookml_dict() method
- generators/lookml.py: _resolve_measure_reference() method
- Test files across unit/integration/golden test suites

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All sub-issues completed
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] 95%+ branch coverage maintained
