# YAML Planning Files

This directory contains YAML planning files generated by `/plan:decompose`.

## Purpose

YAML plans are **intermediate planning artifacts** that get converted into markdown issues via `/plan:create`.

## Why YAML?

YAML provides an editable planning format that allows you to:
- ✅ Review the decomposition before creating issues
- ✅ Make bulk edits to multiple issues at once
- ✅ Commit plans to git for review
- ✅ Share plans with team members
- ✅ Re-run `/plan:create` to update existing issues (idempotent)

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Generate YAML plan
/plan:decompose "Add Redis caching"
# Creates: .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml

# 2. Review and edit
cat .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml
vi .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml

# 3. Commit plan (optional)
git add .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml
git commit -m "docs(planning): add Redis caching plan"

# 4. Create markdown issues
/plan:create .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml
# Creates: .tasks/issues/DTL-001.md, DTL-002.md, etc.

# 5. If needed, edit YAML and re-run
vi .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml
/plan:create .tasks/plans/issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml
# Updates existing issues with changes
```

## YAML Format

```yaml
epic:
  title: "Epic: Feature name"
  description: "Multi-line epic description"
  labels: [type:epic, stack:backend, priority:high]
  status: refinement

  children:
    - title: "Sub-task 1: Component name"
      description: "Detailed description"
      labels: [type:feature, stack:backend]
      status: refinement
```

## File Naming

Convention: `issue-plan-{kebab-case-feature-name}.yaml`

Examples:
- `issue-plan-redis-caching.yaml`
- `issue-plan-user-authentication.yaml`
- `issue-plan-test-coverage.yaml`

## Git Tracking

YAML plans **are tracked in git** because:
- They document planning decisions
- They can be reviewed in PRs
- They serve as audit trail
- They can be shared with team

## Cleanup

Feel free to delete old YAML plans after issues are created and refined. The markdown issues in `.tasks/issues/` are the source of truth.

Or keep them as planning documentation - up to you!
