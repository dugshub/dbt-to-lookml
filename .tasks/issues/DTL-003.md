# DTL-003: Generate dimension-only field sets in views

## Problem Statement

Implement automatic generation of `set: dimensions_only` in all view files, containing references to all dimension fields (including hidden entities).

## What needs to be built

- Add `_generate_dimension_set()` method to `LookMLGenerator` class
- Collect all dimension names from a `SemanticModel` (entities + dimensions)
- Create `LookMLSet(name="dimensions_only", fields=[...])` with all dimension names
- Update `_generate_view_lookml()` to include the generated set in view output
- Include hidden entity dimensions in the set (needed for join keys)

## Why it's needed (connection to epic)

This implements the core mechanism for constraining field exposure. The dimension-only set will be referenced in explore joins to prevent measures from dimensional views appearing in fact explores.

## Technical scope from labels

Backend work in `src/dbt_to_lookml/generators/lookml.py`:
- Add set generation logic to LookMLGenerator
- Integrate with existing view generation pipeline
- Maintain existing view structure (entities → dimensions → measures)
- Ensure sets are positioned correctly in LookML output

## Testing requirements

- Unit tests for _generate_dimension_set() method
- Verify all dimensions (including hidden) are included
- Test set appears in correct position in generated LookML
- Ensure empty sets are handled gracefully (views with no dimensions)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
