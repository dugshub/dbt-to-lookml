# DTL-002: Add LookML set support to schemas

## Problem Statement

Extend the Pydantic schema models to support LookML field sets, which are used to group fields for reuse in explores and joins.

## What needs to be built

- Add `LookMLSet` Pydantic model to `schemas.py` representing a LookML `set:` block
- Add optional `sets: List[LookMLSet]` field to `LookMLView` model
- Update `LookMLView.to_lookml_dict()` to include sets in output dictionary
- Ensure sets appear after sql_table_name but before dimensions in generated LookML

## Why it's needed (connection to epic)

Sets are the foundation for field exposure control in explores. This schema support enables the generator to create and reference dimension-only sets in join definitions.

## Technical scope from labels

Backend work in `src/dbt_to_lookml/schemas.py`:
- Add new Pydantic models with full type hints (mypy --strict compliance)
- Maintain backward compatibility (sets are optional)
- Follow existing schema patterns (BaseModel, Optional fields, to_lookml_dict methods)

## Testing requirements

- Unit tests for LookMLSet model validation
- Unit tests for LookMLView.to_lookml_dict() with sets
- Verify sets serialize correctly to LookML format

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
