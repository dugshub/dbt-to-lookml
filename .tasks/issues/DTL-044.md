# DTL-044: Wire PoP into generation pipeline

## Problem Statement

Integrate PoP generation into the main LookML generator workflow.

## What to Build

- Add PoP detection in `generate()` method
- Call PoP generators when measures with pop config exist
- Ensure PoP dimensions/parameters appear before measures in output
- Handle models with mixed pop/non-pop measures
- Maintain backward compatibility for models without PoP

## Why It's Needed

The individual PoP generators need to be orchestrated within the existing
generation pipeline to produce correct, complete LookML output.

## Technical Scope

- File: `src/dbt_to_lookml/generators/lookml.py`
- Modify `generate()` method
- Add PoP detection helper
- Ensure proper ordering in output dict

## Success Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end generation with pop-enabled model works
- [ ] Generation with mixed pop/non-pop measures works
- [ ] Generation with no pop measures unchanged (backward compat)
- [ ] Output ordering correct (dimensions, parameters, measures)
- [ ] Integration test with full semantic model passes
