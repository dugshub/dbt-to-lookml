# DTL-005: Update unit tests for field sets and joins

## Problem Statement

Update unit tests in `src/tests/unit/` to cover new field set generation and join field constraints.

## What needs to be built

- Add tests to `test_lookml_generator.py` for dimension set generation
- Add tests for join fields parameter in explore generation
- Update existing test fixtures to expect sets in view output
- Update existing join tests to expect fields parameter
- Test edge cases: views with no dimensions, hidden-only dimensions, multi-hop joins with fields

## Why it's needed (connection to epic)

Unit tests ensure the field exposure control logic works correctly in isolation and maintains code coverage targets (95% branch coverage).

## Technical scope from labels

Backend testing work in `src/tests/unit/`:
- Add test cases to test_lookml_generator.py
- Update test fixtures and expected outputs
- Maintain 95% branch coverage target
- Follow pytest conventions and use parametrize for variations

## Testing requirements

- All new methods have corresponding unit tests
- Edge cases are covered (empty sets, hidden fields, etc.)
- Tests use clear arrange-act-assert structure
- Run with `make test-fast` for quick validation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
