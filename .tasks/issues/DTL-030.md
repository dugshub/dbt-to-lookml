# DTL-030: Research and document LookML field organization patterns

## Problem Statement

Conduct research on LookML's field organization parameters and document best practices for time dimension organization.

## Scope

- Research `group_label`, `label`, and `group_item_label` parameters in LookML
- Document how dimension_group automatically creates field groupings
- Create examples showing current behavior vs. desired hierarchical organization
- Document interaction between these parameters for time dimensions
- Identify configuration precedence rules
- Create technical design doc for implementation approach

## Deliverables

- Technical design document (can be in issue comments or .tasks/docs/)
- Code examples showing LookML output before/after
- Precedence rules documentation

## Testing

- Review LookML official documentation
- Validate examples against Looker field picker behavior (if possible)

## Links

- Epic: [DTL-029](./../epics/DTL-029.md)
- Strategy: [.tasks/strategies/DTL-030-strategy.md](./../strategies/DTL-030-strategy.md)
- Spec: [.tasks/specs/DTL-030-spec.md](./../specs/DTL-030-spec.md)

## History

### 2025-11-19 16:45 - Implementation Complete
Research task completed and verified. All deliverables confirmed to exist:
- ✅ Strategy document: `.tasks/strategies/DTL-030-strategy.md` (comprehensive research)
- ✅ Specification: `.tasks/specs/DTL-030-spec.md` (detailed implementation guide)
- ✅ LookML parameter research completed (group_label, label, group_item_label)
- ✅ Configuration precedence design documented
- ✅ Implementation approach recommended
- ✅ Integration analysis completed
- ✅ Test coverage plan defined (95%+ target)
- ✅ Implementation sequence documented (DTL-031 through DTL-035)
Status updated to Done with state:complete label. Ready for next phase (DTL-031).

### 2025-11-19 14:30 - Spec Completed
Implementation spec created at .tasks/specs/DTL-030-spec.md
- Detailed implementation plan for research and documentation deliverables
- All research deliverables marked as completed (strategy document)
- Configuration precedence design documented
- Implementation approach recommendation finalized
- Integration analysis completed
- Test coverage plan defined (95%+ target)
- Implementation sequence documented (DTL-031 through DTL-035)
- Issue status updated to Ready with state:has-spec label

### 2025-11-19 - Strategy Completed
Comprehensive research completed and documented in .tasks/strategies/DTL-030-strategy.md
- Researched LookML group_label, label, and group_item_label parameters
- Documented interaction with dimension_group
- Designed configuration precedence chain (dimension > generator > CLI > default)
- Identified integration points with existing features (hierarchy, convert_tz, hidden, bi_field)
- Created before/after examples and test coverage plan
- Recommended extending ConfigMeta with time_dimension_group_label field
